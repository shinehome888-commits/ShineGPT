# 🌍 shineGPT — Phase 1: Base Test

This is the foundation of shineGPT — a simple Streamlit app deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

**Goal**: Prove that Hugging Face can run a basic app — before adding AI, voice, or lessons.

- ✅ No internet required to deploy  
- ✅ No complex dependencies  
- ✅ No AI model  
- ✅ Just Streamlit

This is the first step toward building an AI tutor that works for children with no internet.

Next steps:  
→ Add 50 offline lessons  
→ Add voice output  
→ Add voice input  
→ Make it work on any phone
