### 🚀 What Is ShineGPT?

**ShineGPT** is a free, lightweight AI tutor built for children in communities where internet is slow, expensive, or unavailable.

It has **two ways to learn** — both work without credit cards, subscriptions, or data plans:

| Mode | How It Works | Works Without Internet? |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| 📱 **SMS Mode** | Type `lesson 1`, `what is ai`, or `help` → get instant text answers | ✅ Yes |
| 💻 **Online Mode** | Ask questions like “What is blockchain?” → get clear AI answers | ✅ Yes (if connected) |

Built with **Microsoft Phi-3-mini** — a fast, small, powerful AI that runs on Hugging Face Spaces — and **50 offline lessons** on AI, IoT, Blockchain, and the future of work.

> ✅ **No voice. No downloads. No crashes. Just knowledge.**

### 📚 The 50 Lessons (SMS Mode — Zero Internet)

Type any of these in the chat:

- `lesson 1` → *“The 4th Industrial Revolution is when technology like AI, robots, and the internet merge with our physical world...”*
- `lesson 50` → *“Every device connected to the internet becomes part of the IoT — and every device needs to be protected.”*
- `points` → See how many lessons you’ve completed

Each lesson gives you **+10 points**. Complete all 50 → earn **500 points**.

No login. No account. No internet needed.

---

### 💬 Online Mode — Ask Anything

When you have internet, ask questions like:

> _“Explain AI like I’m 10.”_  
> _“How does blockchain work?”_  
> _“What is Web3?”_

You’ll get clear, simple answers — powered by **Microsoft Phi-3-mini**, a model designed for low-resource devices.

No GPT-4. No API keys. No cost.  
Just **real AI, built for real people**.

### 🌱 Why This Matters

In rural Africa:
- 60% of students have **no reliable internet**
- Data costs more than meals in some places
- Schools have no books, no teachers, no computers

**shineGPT meets them where they are.**  
With a phone. With a text message. With a dream.

> 💬 *“I can’t read… but I can speak. And now I can learn.”*
